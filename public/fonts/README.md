# Font Files Directory

Place your Aeonik font files in this directory.

## Required Files

You'll need the following font files (in order of preference):

1. **Aeonik-Regular.woff2** (or .woff / .ttf)
2. **Aeonik-Medium.woff2** (or .woff / .ttf) - optional but recommended
3. **Aeonik-Bold.woff2** (or .woff / .ttf)

## Where to Get Aeonik Font

Aeonik is a commercial font available from:
- CoType Foundry: https://cotypefoundry.com/our-fonts/aeonik

Make sure you have the appropriate license before using the font.

## File Naming

The font files should be named exactly as shown above. If your font files have different names, you'll need to update the `@font-face` declarations in `app/globals.css`.

## Fallback

If the font files are not present, the website will fall back to system fonts.
